## Who am I?

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A GAME DEVELOPER.

I am [Daniela Petruzalek](https://linkedin.com/in/petruzalek), a Developer Relations Engineer at Google. I am the author and facilitator of this workshop. I might not be a game developer, but I am a lifetime gamer and game collector, and enjoy using projects like this to teach modern software engineering concepts like agentic coding, generative AI and other ways to use AI to unlock your creativity!

## Session Overview

After a brief intro of the Gemini model family and the Antigravity coding agent, the participants are invited to build 2D games in Go using Ebitengine v2, using Google Gemini models for coding, image generation (Nano Banana) and audio generation (Lyria 3).


### Design Approach

The skills and reference modules here are generic building blocks for any 2D game genre—arcade, puzzle, platformer, strategy, RPG, or rhythm games. Snippets like pathfinding, collision, or UI components are modular references that developers and coding agents adapt to fit specific mechanics. Start your session by activating the `/vibe-game-developer` skill and work with Antigravity to build your game!

## Agent Skills

### Orchestration & Design

- [`vibe-game-developer`](.agents/skills/vibe-game-developer/SKILL.md)  
  Routes user requests to the appropriate specialized skill based on the task (architecture, pure-code graphics, AI media generation, testing, or deployment).

- [`game-design`](.agents/skills/game-design/SKILL.md)  
  Guides game concept interviews via `/grill-me` and generates a structured Game Design Document ([`GDD.md`](.agents/skills/game-design/references/gdd_template.md)).

### Engine Architecture & Pure-Code Assets

- [`ebitengineer`](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/SKILL.md)  
  Core engineering rules for Ebitengine v2 games: 16:9 pixel-scaling canvas, 60 FPS delta-time loop, scene state machines, WebAssembly builds, and asset validation.  
  Includes reference guides for [project structure](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/project_structure.md), [server architecture](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/server_architecture.md), [physics & collisions](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/physics_and_collision.md), [tilemaps](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/tilemaps_and_levels.md), [UI layout](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/ui_and_hud.md), [input mapping](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/input_action_mapping.md), [entity pooling](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/entity_management.md), and [A* pathfinding](.agents/skills/ebitengineer/references/pathfinding_and_ai.md).

- [`procedural-art`](.agents/skills/procedural-art/SKILL.md)  
  Code-driven 2D drawing, matrix transformations (`GeoM`), color ramps, particle systems, and Kage shaders.

- [`sprite-animation`](.agents/skills/sprite-animation/SKILL.md)  
  Sprite sheet validation, grid slicing, animation controllers, Aseprite binary format parsing, and integration with `SolarLune/goaseprite`. Includes Go implementation in [`references/animation_controller.go`](.agents/skills/sprite-animation/references/animation_controller.go) and format reference in [`references/aseprite_format.md`](.agents/skills/sprite-animation/references/aseprite_format.md).

- [`procedural-composer`](.agents/skills/procedural-composer/SKILL.md)  
  Pure-code DSP synthesis engine, FM synthesis, ADSR envelopes, JSON sound specs, and CLI audio player.

### Generative AI Media Skills

- [`nano-banana`](.agents/skills/nano-banana/SKILL.md)  
  Image generation using Nano Banana models (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image`, `gemini-3.1-flash-image`, `gemini-3-pro-image`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image`). Handles pixel art sprites and character-consistent generation. Run via `uv run .agents/skills/nano-banana/scripts/banana.py`.

- [`lyria`](.agents/skills/lyria/SKILL.md)  
  44.1 kHz stereo audio generation using Lyria 3 models (`lyria-3-clip-preview` for 30-second loops and `lyria-3-pro-preview` for full tracks). Run via `uv run .agents/skills/lyria/scripts/lyria.py`.

### Quality & Workflow

- [`godoctor`](.agents/skills/godoctor/SKILL.md)  
  Go code quality enforcement using Google Go Style guidelines, SQL test analysis, and Selene mutation testing.

- [`swarm-coding`](.agents/skills/swarm-coding/SKILL.md)  
  Decomposes complex engineering features into isolated subtasks for parallel execution.

### 3D Pipeline (Blender → Godot 4)

- [`blender-godot-pipeline`](.agents/skills/blender-godot-pipeline/SKILL.md)
  Routes 3D requests to [`pipeline3d/`](pipeline3d/README.md): cloud generation (Tripo, Meshy, Hyper3D Rodin), mesh cleanup, quadruped auto-rig with procedural clips, Mixamo/AccuRIG hand-offs, clip merging, clothing weight transfer, UDIM fixes, baking, GLB export and a Godot 4 template with an import plugin, asset viewer, character controller and headless audit. Everything is driven by `forge.py` asset manifests or live through [Blender MCP](https://github.com/sphilius/blender-mcp).

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Go 1.26 or newer
- `uv` Python package runner
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) with Application Default Credentials configured (`gcloud auth application-default login`)

### Environment Pre-Flight Check
Run the included doctor script to verify all local tools before starting:

```bash
./check_env.sh
```

### CLI Tool Verification
Test the image and music generation CLI utilities:

```bash
# Verify Nano Banana image CLI
uv run .agents/skills/nano-banana/scripts/banana.py --help

# Verify Lyria music CLI
uv run .agents/skills/lyria/scripts/lyria.py --help
```
