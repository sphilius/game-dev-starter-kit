# Vibe Game Developer: Master Orchestrator & Request Router

This master skill teaches the agent how to analyze, classify, and route user game development requests to the specialized skill best suited for the task.

> [!NOTE]
> **Genre-Agnostic Design Principle**:
> All skills and reference modules in this suite provide **generic, highly adaptable building blocks suitable for any 2D game genre** (puzzle, arcade, strategy, platformer, racing, rhythm, RPG, shmup, or simulation). Specific code examples (such as progress bars, jump gravity curves, or A* pathfinding) are illustrative patterns—apply and adapt only the components that fit the game's unique design and mechanics.

## 1. Skill Selection & Intent Routing Matrix

When responding to user requests, evaluate the underlying engineering need and activate the primary specialized skill according to this decision matrix:

| User Intent / Request Type | Primary Specialized Skill | Key Technical Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Game Design & Concept Probing** | **[`game-design`](../game-design/SKILL.md)** | Game Designer role: interactive `/grill-me` probing interview, mechanics, controls, art/audio strategy, and `GDD.md` creation. |
| **Ebitengine 2D Game Architecture** | **[`ebitengineer`](../ebitengineer/SKILL.md)** | Ebitengine game loop, 16:9 canvas, FSM scene flow, WASM touch, Cloud Run deployment, plus 6 core engine modules: Physics/Collisions (`AABB`/Spatial Hash), Tilemaps/Autotiling, UI/HUD (9-slice/anchors), Action Mapping, Entity Pools/ECS, and A* Pathfinding/AI. |
| **Pure-Code DSP Audio Synthesis** | **[`procedural-composer`](../procedural-composer/SKILL.md)** | Zero-asset runtime DSP sound engine (`sound.go`), YM2612 6-channel polyphony, FM synthesis, ADSR envelopes, JSON sound format, and CLI player (`play.go`). |
| **Generative CD-Quality AI Music** | **[`lyria`](../lyria/SKILL.md)** | High-fidelity 44.1 kHz stereo music (`lyria-3-clip-preview` & `lyria-3-pro-preview`), custom lyrics, section tags (`[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`), multimodal image-to-music, and `.mp3`/`.wav` export. |
| **Pure-Code Procedural 2D Graphics** | **[`procedural-art`](../procedural-art/SKILL.md)** | Pure-code Go texture generation (`art.go`), 2D matrix transformation math (`GeoM`), 32-bit RGBA color ramps, non-linear easing, pre-allocated particle pools, and Kage shaders. |
| **Generative AI Images & Pixel Art** | **[`nano-banana`](../nano-banana/SKILL.md)** | Conversational image generation via Gemini Nano Banana models (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`, `gemini-3.1-pro-image`), pixel art prompts, and character consistency (Anime Dani / Chibi Dani). |
| **2D Sprite Animation (Animator Role)** | **[`sprite-animation`](../sprite-animation/SKILL.md)** | Animator subagent role: sprite sheet grid slicing, animation tag state machines, Aseprite `.ase`/`.aseprite` parsing, `SolarLune/goaseprite` integration, and Go controllers. |
| **Go Code Quality & Testing** | **[`godoctor`](../godoctor/SKILL.md)** | Go style guidelines, flat package architecture, `smart_build`, `smart_edit`, TestQuery SQL test log analyzer, and Selene mutation testing. |
| **Parallel Feature Swarm Orchestration** | **[`swarm-coding`](../swarm-coding/SKILL.md)** | Multi-agent parallel task decomposition for full-stack features or large refactorings. |
| **3D Models, Rigging, Animation & Godot 4** | **[`blender-godot-pipeline`](../blender-godot-pipeline/SKILL.md)** | AI 3D generation (Tripo, Meshy, Rodin), Blender cleanup/rig/bake/export scripts, Mixamo/quadruped rigs, clip merging, Blender MCP + Godot MCP, headless `forge.py` manifests. Use for any 3D or Godot request; the rest of this suite is 2D Go/Ebitengine. |

## 2. Decision Rules: Pure-Code Procedural vs. Generative AI Assets

A critical responsibility of this master skill is determining whether an asset request should be built **procedurally in pure Go code** or **generated using Gemini AI models**:

### 2.1 Audio & Music Routing Rules

* **Choose [`procedural-composer`](../procedural-composer/SKILL.md)** when:
  - The user requests **Game Sound Effects (SFX)**: button clicks, coin pick-ups, laser blasts, jumps, explosions, or UI audio cues.
  - The user requests retro chiptune audio, synthesized waveforms, or lightweight FM audio.
  - The game requires zero external `.mp3`/`.wav` dependencies or real-time dynamic pitch/filter manipulation during gameplay.
  - The user requests a JSON sound specification or code-driven audio engine implementation (`sound.go`).

* **Choose [`lyria`](../lyria/SKILL.md)** when:
  - The user requests **Background Music (BGM)**: CD-quality 44.1 kHz stereo music tracks, full songs with custom lyrics, instrumental score beds, or BGM loops.
  - The user wants to compose background music matching a visual reference image or photo.
  - Output music must be exported as standalone `.mp3` or `.wav` audio files.

---

### 2.2 Graphics & Visual Routing Rules

* **Choose [`procedural-art`](../procedural-art/SKILL.md)** when:
  - The user requests pure-code texture generation (`art.go`), vector geometry, dynamic particle systems (explosions, fire, magic), or custom Kage post-processing shaders.
  - The game requires zero disk I/O, infinite resolution scaling, or real-time palette swapping in Go memory.
  - The request involves matrix transformation ordering, sub-frame interpolation curves, or direct bitmap pixel crafting.

* **Choose [`nano-banana`](../nano-banana/SKILL.md)** when:
  - The user requests AI-generated concept art, character avatars, item icons, or AI pixel art sprites (`16x16`, `32x32`, `64x64`).
  - The request specifies character visual consistency for recurring characters (**Anime Dani**, **Daniela**, or **Chibi Dani**).
  - The output is an image file (`.png`/`.jpg`).

## 3. Standard End-to-End Game Workflow

When guiding the user through building a complete 2D game from scratch:

1. **Game Concept & GDD**: Activate `game-design` (`/grill-me`) to probe player vision, define core mechanics, controls, art/audio strategy, and save `GDD.md`.
2. **Architecture & Scope**: Activate `ebitengineer` to set up package structure (`internal/`), 16:9 virtual pixel canvas, delta time ($dt$) 60 FPS timing, and FSM scene progression.
3. **Visual Art & Sprites**:
   - For UI/particle FX/vector geometry $\rightarrow$ Activate `procedural-art`.
   - For character concept art / AI pixel sprite sheets $\rightarrow$ Activate `nano-banana` + `sprite-animation`.
4. **Sound Effects & Music**:
   - For retro SFX & synthesized chiptunes $\rightarrow$ Activate `procedural-composer`.
   - For high-fidelity background music beds $\rightarrow$ Activate `lyria`.
5. **Code Review & Quality Gate**: Activate `godoctor` (`smart_build`, unit testing, Selene mutation testing) to ensure code correctness and test coverage.
6. **Deployment**: Activate `ebitengineer` to compile to WebAssembly and configure Google Cloud Run deployment with multi-stage Docker builds.
